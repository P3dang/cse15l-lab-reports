Installing VS code:

To install VS code visit the VS code website: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and follow the instructions to install VS code for Mac OS/Windows. 
Unzip the file and open VS code from your downloads folder. VS code was already installed on my laptop since I took CSE 8B last quarter so, steps 
for installing on a fresh computer might be different.

Remotely Connecting: 

Before remotely connecting to the UCSD servers, we first need to reset/make our CSE15L account. Follow to to the UCSD account lookup page here: 

[UCSD Acount Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php), and enter your UCSD username and PID. Find and click on the cs15lsp23__. Your username should be displayed 
at the top of the page, make sure to remember it since we will be needing it later. Using this link to change your password: [UCSD Password Changer](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/password.php), 
then click on “Proceed to the Password Change Tool” in blue. Enter your CSE username i.e. cs15lsp23__ where 
it states “Enter your username”. Proceed by clicking on the "I want to reset my course-specific account password" in blue, which will prompt you with a 
DUO app authentication and email confirmation. Open the email and change/reset your password with the instructions provided on the website. Before going 
onto the next step make sure to wait around 5 minutes for the system to recognize your new password.

These next steps can be done with either the Terminal or VS code. Enter the following code into your terminal: ssh _________@ieng6.ucsd.edu, 
replacing the underscore with your CSE 15l account username. The terminal should prompt you with “Are you sure you want to continue connecting 
(yes/no/[fingerprint])?” just type in yes. Next enter your new password that was created earlier into the terminal. You will know you’ve successfully 
logged in when the terminal looks like this.
